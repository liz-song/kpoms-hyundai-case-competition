## Project Overview  
- **Competition:** 2021 KPOMS Fall Conference - 9th Hyundai Motors University Case Presentation Competition  
- **Hosted by:** Korean Production and Operations Management Society (KPOMS), Hyundai Motors  
- **Topic:** Research and business case analysis on mobility platform strategies and business models in response to the paradigm shift of Transportation as a Service (TaaS)  
- **Objective:** Proposing an optimized site selection strategy for UAM vertiports and developing a platform logic for urban air mobility integration  
- **Approach:**  
  - Identified key factors influencing vertiport site selection, such as traffic volume, transportation inequality index, regional size, and availability of suitable locations  
  - Integrated multiple datasets, including satellite location data, transportation inequality indices, and regional traffic patterns, to establish a data-driven optimization framework

## Problem Definition  
- Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is emerging as a key technology for the future mobility industry, gaining attention from major global corporations.  
- Increasing **traffic congestion and prolonged commuting times** worldwide highlight the limitations of conventional road-based transportation systems.  
- **Environmental concerns related to traffic congestion** emphasize the need for sustainable mobility innovations, making **Urban Air Mobility (Air Mobility) a critical solution.**

## Proposed Solution: Data-Driven Vertiport Site Optimization & Platform Design  
‚úÖ **Identifying optimal vertiport locations through multi-source data analysis**  
   - Analyzed commuting traffic inflow/outflow, traffic volume, and transportation inequality indices in the Seoul metropolitan area  

‚úÖ **Selecting final vertiport locations using spatial data & UAM aircraft size analysis**  
   - Evaluated candidate sites based on UAM aircraft dimensions and satellite imagery to assess feasible locations  

‚úÖ **Developing an integrated UAM mobility platform**  
   - Designed a service model integrating optimal route guidance, automated location setup, fare calculation, and continuous data-driven optimization
